          <h3>Know Cholesterol, before you say NO to Cholesterol</h3>
          <p>
            Not all fats are harmful; some are essential for the body's normal
            functioning. Fats aid in the absorption and storage of fat-soluble
            vitamins (A, D, E, K). Cholesterol, produced from fat metabolism,
            supports digestion, hormone metabolism, and vitamin D synthesis.
            High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is beneficial as it helps remove
            plaque from arteries, while low-density lipoprotein (LDL) can
            contribute to artery clogging.
          </p>

          <h3>Regular Tests</h3>
          <p>
            After the age of 35, regular health checks become vital for
            monitoring overall health and lifestyle. Essential tests include
            cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and diabetes screening.
            Additional tests may be recommended based on age, gender, and
            lifestyle by a heart specialist for better health monitoring and
            lifestyle adjustments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Active Lifestyle</h3>
          <p>
            Being physically active reduces the risk of heart diseases. An
            active lifestyle involves regular movement, such as walking,
            exercise, and strength training sessions. Incorporating basic
            movements at work and activities like gardening or housework at home
            promotes an active lifestyle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Heart-Healthy Diet</h3>
          <p>
            Making simple dietary changes can have long-term health benefits.
            Consume a balanced diet, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains,
            fish, legumes, and healthy fats. Hydration, chewing food slowly, and
            keeping heart-healthy snacks handy are essential dietary practices.
            Limit intake of salt, sugar, red meat, processed foods, and
            high-sugar beverages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Snooze it before you lose it</h3>
          <p>
            Quality sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being. Adults
            need 6-8 hours of sound sleep for optimal recovery. Maintaining a
            consistent sleep schedule, regular exercise, and minimizing screen
            time before bedtime promote good sleep.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Reduce Stress</h3>
          <p>
            Stress management is vital for maintaining heart health. Activities
            such as socializing, exercising, meditation, and pursuing hobbies
            can help reduce stress levels.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Dental Hygiene</h3>
          <p>
            Good dental hygiene is linked to heart health. Basic practices like
            brushing and flossing regularly can reduce the risk of heart
            disease.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stay Away from Tobacco</h3>
          <p>
            Tobacco use, including passive smoking, increases the risk of heart
            disease and other health issues. Avoiding tobacco in all forms is
            essential for maintaining heart health.

          <h3>Personalized Risk Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            By analyzing historical health data and trends, a prediction system
            can provide personalized risk assessments for individuals, guiding
            them towards tailored lifestyle modifications and treatment plans.
            This personalized approach enhances the effectiveness of
            interventions, leading to better health outcomes. (Source: Mayo

          <h3>Early Detection of Abnormalities</h3>
          <p>
            Utilizing machine learning algorithms, a prediction system can
            identify subtle deviations in heart parameters, allowing for early
            detection of abnormalities and potential cardiovascular diseases.
            Early intervention based on these predictions can significantly
            reduce the risk of adverse health events and improve prognosis.

          <h3>Healthcare Resource Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Implementing a prediction system in healthcare settings can optimize
            resource allocation by prioritizing high-risk individuals for timely
            interventions, thus improving overall healthcare efficiency and
            patient outcomes. This targeted approach ensures that limited
            healthcare resources are utilized effectively, maximizing the impact
            on population health. (Source: World Health Organization)

            <p>
              Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when plaque builds up inside
              the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart
              muscle. This narrowing of the arteries restricts blood flow to the
              heart, leading to chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and in
              severe cases, heart attack.

            <h4>Cardiac Arrest</h4>
            <p>
              Cardiac arrest is a sudden, unexpected loss of heart function,
              often caused by an electrical disturbance in the heart that stops
              it from pumping blood effectively. Without prompt treatment,
              cardiac arrest can be fatal within minutes. Immediate CPR and
              defibrillation are vital for survival.

            <h4>Congestive Heart Failure</h4>
            <p>
              Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs when the heart is unable to
              pump blood effectively to meet the body's demands. This results in
              fluid buildup (congestion) in various parts of the body, leading
              to symptoms such as fatigue, swelling in the legs, and shortness
              of breath. CHF requires lifelong management to improve symptoms
              and prevent complications.

            <p>
              Congenital heart disease refers to structural abnormalities of the
              heart that are present at birth. These defects can affect the
              heart chambers, valves, or major blood vessels, leading to
              irregular blood flow and potentially life-threatening
              complications. Treatment may involve medication, surgery, or other
              interventions to correct or manage the defect.
